# Open Organization Definition

## About
Forward-thinking organizations are embracing open principles in order to become more agile, innovative, and engaged. The Open Organization Definition outlines five characteristics of open organizations—transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—and explains how they can serve as a foundation for new organizational behaviors, systems, and structures.

The Open Organization community uses files in this repository to maintain a working definition of "open organization."
